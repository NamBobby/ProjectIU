### Project Overview:  

Music Streaming Website is a special web development project for building an interactive and scalable website for music lovers and independent artists. As a personal project, I used the knowledge I learned to build a website that emphasizes empowering artists to upload and manage their music independently, allowing users to enjoy it. To meet the requirements for this course, we applied ReactJS + Vite for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. (Le Thanh Phuong Nam_23083609_WAD Report, 2025)
